<h1>Qintal Market Intelligence (QMI)</h1>

<p>
Qintal Market Intelligence (QMI) is an early-stage market intelligence platform focused on helping users
<strong>understand financial markets through data, trends, and structured insights</strong>.
The platform is designed for learning, analysis, and decision support — not for giving investment advice.
</p>

<h2>Why QMI Exists</h2>
<p>
Financial market data is widely available, but it is often fragmented, complex, or presented in ways that
are difficult for individuals and small teams to interpret. Many tools are expensive, overly technical,
or mixed with biased recommendations.
</p>

<p>
QMI aims to solve this by offering a <strong>clear, neutral, and educational view of market behavior</strong>,
making it easier to explore trends, sectors, and strategic ideas in one place.
